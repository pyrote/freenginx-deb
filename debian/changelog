    "application/vnd.debian.binary-package" MIME type.
    Thanks to Yuriy Izorkin.

    total size of ignored chunk extensions and trailer headers when
    reading a request body using chunked transfer encoding.
    Thanks to Bartek Nowotarski.

  * Change: now at most one empty line is allowed before a request.

  * Feature: logging to syslog errors are now reported at most once per

    for a long time was possible.
